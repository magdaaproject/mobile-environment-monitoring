# MaGDAA - Mobile Environment Monitoring #

The [Mass Gathering Data Acquisition and Analysis][magdaa] project, MaGDAA for short, is a collaboration between the [Flinders University Disaster Research Centre][fudrc] and [The Serval Project][sp] at [Flinders University][fusa] in South Australia.

The focus of the project is on the development of an [Android][android] based platform that can be used to acquire and analyse data at a mass gathering event. For example at a music festival, Schoolies Week, or any other event where a crowd has gathered.

The focus of this application is in two main parts:

1. Connect to our custom [static temperature and humidity sensor][static] and share the data on a Serval Mesh network
2. Connect to our custom [mobile temperature and humidity sensor][mobile] and share the information with an instance of the [ODK Collect][odk] software.

More information about the software is available in the [MaGDAA Wiki][wiki].
